  This file is empty because I'll be going through a bunch of examples of how to navigate through mathlib.
  Tools I will show off are:
  1) Scrolling through the folders in the explorer on the LHS
  2) Using the search in VS Code to find lemmas by name
  3) ctrl-click or clicking in infoview to get to the correct import file
  4) The mathlib documentation at <https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/index.html>

  I will also show how to deal with namespaces in one of two ways. Either referring to things as 
  
  namespace.object_name 
  
  or

  open namespace
  object_name 

  You should try out a few of these examples by looking at the exercise.lean file in this folder
